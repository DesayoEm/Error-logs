# Debugging logs

Welcome to my personal collection of mistakes, solutions, and debugging notes.

This repository documents errors and fixes I've encountered while working with different tools. 

I'd throw in here about collecting bugs like pokemon cards but I bet no one was having fun when these occurred. üíÄ
